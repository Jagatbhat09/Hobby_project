script filename ----> video_to_frames.py ;

usage :

python video_to_frames.py <filename of the image to be converted to grayscale>

ex :

    suppose "sample.mp4" is file to be converted then
    image to be in the same directory

python video_to_frames.py sample.mp4


once u run the script it creates a directory named sample (which extracts it from the file name) and then stores each frame in frame_count.csv name..



There are many other dependencies to run this script. I'm using ubuntu, i do not the procedure for installing opencv for python

before you run the script u need to install cv2 for python. 


Or it's better if u dual boot ubuntu.. :P
